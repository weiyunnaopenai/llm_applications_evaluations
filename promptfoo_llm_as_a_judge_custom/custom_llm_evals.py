    prompt = f"""Evaluate the following summary based on these criteria:
    1. Conciseness (1-5) - is the summary as concise as possible?
        - Conciseness of 1: The summary is unnecessarily long, including excessive details, repetitions, or irrelevant information. It fails to distill the key points effectively.
        - Conciseness of 3:  The summary captures most key points but could be more focused. It may include some unnecessary details or slightly overexplain certain concepts.
        - Conciseness of 5: The summary effectively condenses the main ideas into a brief, focused text. It includes all essential information without any superfluous details or explanations.
    2. Accuracy (1-5) - is the summary completely accurate based on the initial article'?
        - Accuracy of 1: The summary contains significant errors, misrepresentations, or omissions that fundamentally alter the meaning or key points of the original article.
        - Accuracy of 3:  The summary captures some key points correctly but may have minor inaccuracies or omissions. The overall message is generally correct, but some details may be wrong.
        - Accuracy of 5: The summary faithfully represents the main gist of the original article without any errors or misinterpretations. All included information is correct and aligns with the source material.
    4. Tone (1-5) - is the summary appropriate for a grade school student with no technical training?
        - Tone of 1: The summary uses language or concepts that are too complex, technical, or mature for a grade school audience. It may contain jargon, advanced terminology, or themes that are not suitable for young readers.
        - Tone of 2:  The summary mostly uses language suitable for grade school students but occasionally includes terms or concepts that may be challenging. Some explanations might be needed for full comprehension.
        - Tone of 3: The summary consistently uses simple, clear language that is easily understandable by grade school students. It explains complex ideas in a way that is accessible and engaging for young readers.
    5. Explanation - a general description of the way the summary is evaluated

    Artificial neural networks are computer systems inspired by how the human brain works. They are made up of interconnected "neurons" that process information. These networks can learn to do tasks by looking at lots of examples, similar to how humans learn. 

    Some key things about neural networks:
    - They can recognize patterns and make predictions
    - They improve with more data and practice
    - They're used for things like identifying objects in images, translating languages, and playing games

    Neural networks are a powerful tool in artificial intelligence and are behind many of the "smart" technologies we use today. While they can do amazing things, they still aren't as complex or capable as the human brain.

    Should receive a 5 for tone, a 5 for accuracy, and a 5 for conciseness

    Here is a summary of the key points from the article on artificial neural networks (ANNs):

    1. ANNs are computational models inspired by biological neural networks in animal brains. They consist of interconnected artificial neurons that process and transmit signals.

    2. Basic structure:
    - Input layer receives data
    - Hidden layers process information 
    - Output layer produces results
    - Neurons are connected by weighted edges

    3. Learning process:
    - ANNs learn by adjusting connection weights
    - Use techniques like backpropagation to minimize errors
    - Can perform supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning

    4. Key developments:
    - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing
    - Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data
    - Deep learning with many hidden layers

    5. Applications:
    - Pattern recognition, classification, regression
    - Computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing
    - Game playing, robotics, financial modeling

    6. Advantages:
    - Can model complex non-linear relationships
    - Ability to learn and generalize from data
    - Adaptable to many different types of problems

    7. Challenges:
    - Require large amounts of training data
    - Can be computationally intensive
    - "Black box" nature can make interpretability difficult

    8. Recent advances:
    - Improved hardware (GPUs) enabling deeper networks
    - New architectures like transformers for language tasks
    - Progress in areas like generative AI

    The article provides a comprehensive overview of ANN concepts, history, types, applications, and ongoing research areas in this field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
